## Project Structure

The project follows a structure typical for Next.js applications using the App Router:

```
app/

‚îú‚îÄ mainChart.tsx # Line charts for review trends

‚îú‚îÄ mainTable.tsx # Combined app performance table

‚îú‚îÄ sectionKPI.tsx # KPI summary cards

‚îú‚îÄ rankKPI.tsx # App ranking KPI card

‚îú‚îÄ ratingKPI.tsx # App rating & CSAT KPI cards

‚îú‚îÄ navbar.tsx # Responsive navigation bar

‚îú‚îÄ detailed_view/

‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ androidTable.tsx # Android-specific app data

‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ iosTable.tsx # iOS-specific app data

‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ page.tsx # Detailed view page

‚îú‚îÄ documentation/

‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ faq.tsx # FAQ accordion

‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ page.tsx # Documentation page

‚îú‚îÄ layout.tsx # Root layout and global styles

‚îú‚îÄ page.tsx # Main dashboard page

‚îî‚îÄ globals.css # Tailwind and custom styles

```

## Customization

The dashboard is designed to be easily customizable:

-   **Add/Remove Apps**: Modify the `combinedTable` data arrays (typically found within the table components or a shared data file) to add new apps or update metrics.
-   **Change KPI Metrics**: Update the `CategoriesRating` and `CategoriesRank` arrays or similar data structures in [`app/sectionKPI.tsx`](app/sectionKPI.tsx) to customize which KPIs are displayed on the summary cards.
-   **Styling**: Adjust Tailwind CSS utility classes directly in the components or extend the theme in [`tailwind.config.ts`](tailwind.config.ts) for branding, color scheme changes, or typography adjustments.
-   **Component Reuse**: All visualization components (charts, tables, KPI cards) are modular and can be reused or extended for new data sources or different metrics.

## Technologies Used

-   **Next.js**: A powerful React framework for building full-stack web applications. Used here for server-side rendering, static site generation, routing (App Router), and an optimized developer experience.
-   **Tremor**: A modern UI component library specifically designed for building dashboards with React. It provides pre-built charts, cards, and tables that are easy to integrate and customize.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid development of custom user interfaces directly in your markup.
-   **Heroicons**: A set of high-quality, handcrafted SVG icons by the makers of Tailwind CSS, used for iconography throughout the application.
-   **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing. This helps in catching errors early, improving code quality, and making the codebase more maintainable and scalable.
